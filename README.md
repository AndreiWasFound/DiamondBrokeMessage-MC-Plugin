# DiamondBrokeMessage-MC-Plugin
Tells every player in the server AND the console that PLAYERNAME broke a diamond ore.

Good for a survival server with friends that may be xrayers :)

**Wiki page:**

This is a simple plugin that tells every player in the server that PLAYERNAME broke a diamond ore.

There are no options for this plugin, but _maybe_ there will be more added in the future, but for now, just this simple plugin.

Also this plugin is available on spigot: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/diamondbrokemessage.80958/
